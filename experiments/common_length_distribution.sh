# Generate samples from two sets of fasta files, so that they have a common
# length distribution
#
# The general idea is to subsample both sets so that each sampled set will have
# identical length distributions. However, the technique used here settles for
# length distributions that are similar rather than identical.
#
# Requiring identical distributions would bias against longer reads. Specific
# long read lengths are rare -- for example, if one set has a single read
# of length 300,000 and the other set has one of length 300,007, neither would
# be chosen in a common *identical* distribution.
#
# To allow for that situation, we bin similar lengths then create distributions
# that are identical with respect to the bin counts. In the long read example
# above, the bin covering lengths 300,000 and 300,007 would have a non-zero
# count in both sets, so the common distribution would contain a non-zero count
# for that bin.
#
# We use a logarithmic binning formula so longer lengths have much wider bins.
# At length 400 the bin size is 5, while at length 300K bin it's about 10K.
#
# Note that we do not modify sequences. It's possible to achieve distribution
# similarity by truncating some sequences, but we do not do that.
