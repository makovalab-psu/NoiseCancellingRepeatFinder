### Brief Tutorial, Finding Repeats in Noisy Sequence Data

This directory contains a toy example in a small fasta file, example.fa, and
expected results files -- expected.unfiltered.ncrf, expected.filtered.ncrf, and
expected.summary.

#### (1) Run Noise Cancelling Repeat Finder to align sequence to repeats.

```bash 
    cat example.fa \
      | ../NCRF GGAAT \
          --minlength=500 --maxnoise=20% \
          --stats=events --positionalevents \
      | ../ncrf_words.py --minwordratio=0 \
      | ../ncrf_sort.py --sortby=mratio \
      > example.unfiltered.ncrf
```

The output file should match expected.unfiltered.ncrf.

The output consists of a series of alignment blocks, each showing an alignment
between a subsequence of the input and a repeated version of a motif. A typical
alignment block is shown here:

```bash 
# score=1193 querybp=771 mRatio=91.7% m=744 mm=9 i=40 d=18 ==========x=======...
NCRF_EXAMPLE                       50000 793bp 31854-32647 GAATGGAATGCAATGGAA...
GGAAT+                                   771bp score=1193  GAATGGAATGgAATGGAA...
# position 0 [G] mRatio=88.8% m=143 mm=2 i=7 d=9 mmA=1 mmC=1 mmG=0 mmT=0 x=18
# position 1 [G] mRatio=91.5% m=151 mm=4 i=10 d=0 mmA=2 mmC=1 mmG=0 mmT=1 x=14
# position 2 [A] mRatio=93.8% m=150 mm=1 i=6 d=3 mmA=0 mmC=0 mmG=1 mmT=0 x=10
# position 3 [A] mRatio=93.3% m=154 mm=0 i=11 d=0 mmA=0 mmC=0 mmG=0 mmT=0 x=11
# position 4 [T] mRatio=91.3% m=146 mm=2 i=6 d=6 mmA=0 mmC=1 mmG=1 mmT=0 x=14
# aligned words GGAAT:95 gaat:9 ggaa:5 gggaat:3 ggat:3 ggacat:3 ggaact:3 ...
```

The first line gives the alignment score, the number of bases from the repeated
motif sequence (the "query") that were aligned, the "match ratio" (defined
below), the number of matched bases ("m"), mismatched bases ("mm"), bases
inserted into the repeated motif ("i"), and bases deleted from the repeated
motif ("d"). The last part of the line shows where there are errors in the
alignment (mismatches or indels), an "=" indicating a match and an "x"
indicating an indel. In the example, we have an alignment of a 771 bp query
(the repeated motif) with 9 mismatches, 40 insertions and 18 deletions. Note
that the actual line is much longer than shown here (the same is true for the
second and third lines).

Note: we regard indels as having been introduced as sequencing errors, and the
repeated motif as having existed, perfectly repeated, in the molecule that was
sequenced.  Thus insertions are bases in the sequence but not in the repeated
motif, and deletions are bases in the repeated motif but not in the sequence.

The second line shows the name of the aligned sequence, its full length, the
length of the aligned segment, the coordinates of the aligned segment, and the
segment's nucleotides. Any deletions are shown as dashes. In this example we
aligned a 793 bp segment of the 50,000 bp sequence, from position 31,854 up to,
but not including, position 32,647. Note that the coordinates are zero-based
and exclude the end position.

The third line shows the repeat motif, the orientation in which it was aligned
(+ or -), the length of the aligned repeat sequence (same as "querybp" as from
line 1), the alignment score (same as from line 1), and the aligned repeat
sequence nucleotides. Any insertions are shown as dashes, and any mismatches
are shown in lower case. In the example, the motif GGAAT aligned in forward (+)
orientation. The motif was repeated enough times to create a 771 bp sequence.
Positions 0 through 9 match the aligned segment; position 10 has a G where the
segment has a C.

Match ratio is the percentage of alignment columns that are matches. 100%
indicates a perfect alignment and lower numbers indicate more errors. The
formula is mRatio = m/(m+mm+i+d).

After the first three lines, alignment statistics are broken down by position
within the repeat motif. mRatio, m, mm, i, and d have the same meaning as for
the first line. mmA, mmC, mmG, and mmT are mismatch counts for each substituted
nucleotide. x is the sum of mm, i, and d. In the example above we see the
errors are a little less prevalent in position 0 (lower mRatio, higher x),
which might suggest that another motif is be a better match for this query
segment (or for parts of it). Reporting of these statistics can be disabled by
removing "--positionalevents" from the NCRF command line. 

Following the positional alignment stats is a line showing counts of the query
"words" the motif was aligned to. In this example, the motif was aligned to
GGAAT 95 times, GAAT 9 times, and several other words a few times each. This
suggests that our motif, GGAAT, is the correct motif for this segment. If we
had a count for some other motif nearly as high as for GGAAT, that would
suggest GGAAT wasn't a good match. Reporting of these counts can be disabled by
removing ncrf_words from the command pipeline.

#### (2) False alignments to similar motifs.

One of the difficulties that arises, because we allow so much noise in the
alignments, is a motif will align to segments that are better matches for
other, similar, motifs. This is demonstrated by the following example, which
begins at line 161.

```bash 
# score=789 querybp=801 mRatio=84.7% m=698 mm=19 i=23 d=84 ========x====x==x=...
NCRF_EXAMPLE                       50000 740bp 37074-37814 TGGAATGG-ATGGAAAAG...
GGAAT+                                   801bp score=789   TGGAATGGAATGG-AAtG...
# position 0 [G] mRatio=89.7% m=148 mm=3 i=5 d=9 mmA=0 mmC=2 mmG=0 mmT=1 x=17
# position 1 [G] mRatio=94.0% m=157 mm=3 i=7 d=0 mmA=0 mmC=1 mmG=0 mmT=2 x=10
# position 2 [A] mRatio=51.5% m=85 mm=4 i=5 d=71 mmA=0 mmC=1 mmG=3 mmT=0 x=80
# position 3 [A] mRatio=92.1% m=152 mm=8 i=5 d=0 mmA=0 mmC=3 mmG=1 mmT=4 x=13
# position 4 [T] mRatio=96.3% m=156 mm=1 i=1 d=4 mmA=1 mmC=0 mmG=0 mmT=0 x=6
# aligned words ggat:58 GGAAT:51 gat:5 gaat:4 ggatt:4 gga:3 ggaaat:3 gtgat:3 ...
```

We have an alignment of GGAAT to a segment that might actually a better match
for GGAT. This is evident from two facts. First, the alignment errors are
highly skewed toward motif position 2 (mRatio=51.5%), where a large number (71)
of deletions were observed. Second, our motif is aligned to GGAT (58) as often
as to GGAAT (51). In fact, this segment probably contains a mix of those two
motifs.

#### (3) Filtering for error uniformity.

Error_non_uniformity_filter.py is a post processor that automatically discards
alignments like the one in the previous example. It performs a statistical
test on the positional alignment stats and discards an alignment if the stats
are inconsistent with a uniform distribution across the motif positions.

Run Noise Cancelling Repeat Finder again, passing the output through the error
non-uniformity filter.

```bash 
    cat example.fa \
      | ../NCRF GGAAT \
          --minlength=500 --maxnoise=20% \
          --stats=events --positionalevents \
      | ../error_non_uniformity_filter.py \
      | ../ncrf_words.py --minwordratio=0 \
      | ../ncrf_sort.py --sortby=mratio \
      > example.filtered.ncrf
```

The output file should match expected.filtered.ncrf. Comparing to the earlier
unfiltered output, the suspect alignment is not included in the filtered output.

#### (4) Alignment summary.

Pass the output through ncrf_summary to get a tabular listing of the aligned
segments.

```bash 
    ../ncrf_cat.py example.filtered.ncrf \
      | ../ncrf_summary.py \
      > example.summary
```

The tab-delimited output should look like this:

```bash 
#line motif seq          start end   strand seqLen querybp mRatio m    mm i  d

```

The first column is the line number of the alignment in the alignment file. The
second column is the motif, e.g. GGAAT. Columns 3 through 5, "seq", "start",
and "end", report the sequence and position of the aligned segment (coordinates
are zero-based and exclude the end position).  Column 6, "strand", shows the
orientation in which the motif was aligned.  Column 7, "seqLen", is the full
length of the sequence containing the alignment. Column 8, "querybp", is the
number of motif bases in the alignment.  The remaining five columns, "mRatio",
"m", "mm", "i", and "d", are as defined earlier.
