# Noise Cancelling Repeat Finder &mdash; Mock Genomes

Simulated PacBio and Oxford Nanopore reads from fake genomes embedded with some
tandem repeats.

There are two genomes here. "Mock_hg38" mimics the distribution of repeat
arrays in the human reference genome (hg38). "Genome3" contains a mix of
arrays of a few specific motifs, and off-by-one motifs.

# Mock hg38 Genome

Tandem Repeat Finder was used to identify long near-perfect repeat arrays in\
hg38. The search was limited to the autosomes, chromosome X, and the non-PAR
portion of chromosome Y. Motif length up to 200 bp were allowed. Arrays shorter
that 500 bp were ignored, as were any with more than than 5% mismatches or 1%
indels. Overlapping arrays were also discarded.

A mock genome was then created, consisting of a mix of repeats and random
sequence. The mock genome contained one repeat array for each array found in
the human reference, with a perfect repeat of the consensus for that array and
length matching the discovered array. Repeats were positioned randomly across a
single-sequence "genome", with a minimum separation of 500 bp between
neighboring repeats. A repeat can begin anywhere within its repeated motif, and
can appear as either forward or reverse complement.

Total length of the genome is 1.4Mbp, of which 822Kbp is repeats, in 847 arrays.

The genome is in mock_hg38.fa.gz. Positions of the embedded motifs, in the
genome, are recorded in mock_hg38.truth.dat. Positions of the corresponding
arrays in hg38 are in hg38.repeat_arrays.dat; however, these are not in the
same order as mock_hg38.truth.dat.

Fake reads were sampled from this genome, separately simulating PacBio and
Oxford Nanopore sequencing error profiles. The error profiles were derived from
published alignments (details are, or will be, in the manuscript). For PacBio
this was 1.7% mismatch rate, 8.9% single-base insertion, 4.3% single-base
deletion. For Oxford Nanopore, this was 4.6% mismatch rate, 3.8% single-base
insertion, 7.7% single-base deletion.

Overall coverage (of the genome) is intended to be about 5X. Read lengths were
pulled from a distribution with min=1K, max=20K, and mu=7,333 (the p.d.f. drops
linearly from a high at 1K to zero at 20K). This distribution was chosen as a
crude match for commonality of observed length distributions in published reads
for both PacBio and Oxford Nanopore -- though both technologies can produce
reads up to ten times this length, such reads are a very small part of the
observed distributions.

The simulated reads are in mock_hg38.pacbio.fa.gz and mock_hg38.nanopore.fa.gz.
True alignments of the reads, to the genome, are recorded in mock_hg38.pacbio.cigars
and mock_hg38.nanopore.cigars.

True alignments of the embedded motif intervals on the reads are recorded in
mock_hg38.pacbio.truth.ncrf and mock_hg38.nanopore.truth.ncrf.gz, and more
consisely in mock_hg38.pacbio.truth.summary.gz and
mock_hg38.nanopore.truth.summary.gz. **Note that while these are in a format
similar to the output from NcRF, they were not generated by an aligner.**
Instead, they are derived from the truth that was generated by the simulation
process.


# Mock Genome 3

The genome is a mix of random sequence and tandem repeats. The primary repeat
elements have periods of 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 171 bp, shown below. GGAAT is a
highly studied 5-mer, and the 171-mer is alpha satellite. The other four are
randomly generated sequences.

These are the six primary repeat elements:

```bash  
GGAAT
CACTGCTGGT
GTTAGCGGTCGTGCTGATGG
GGCTCCTATCTCGCCTGTTCCCGGGTTCCTCTTATTCTCA
GAGATTGGAGTCCAAGAAATTCAGTCACCTTTCAGCGGTTCCAGTCACGGCGCTAAGTGCCTATTGACCCGCTACTGTTT
TCTGTCTAGTTTTTATATGAAGATATTCCCTTTTCCACCATAATCCTCAAAGCGCTCCAAATATCCACTTGCAGATTCTACAAAAAGAGTGTTTCCAAACTGCTCTATCAAAAGAAATGTTCAACTCTGTGAGTTGAATACACACATCACAAAGAAGTTTCTGAGAATGCT
```  

A total of 2,000 repeats were generated, with lengths sampled from a normal
distribution with mu=1000, sigma=400, but with minimum length 500. About half
of the repeats were chosen from the six primary elements. The others were from
elements with edit distance 1 from those -- these elements are intended as
false positive bait for processes searching for the primary elements.

Repeats were positioned randomly across a single-sequence "genome", with a
minimum separation of 500 bp between neighboring repeats. A repeat can begin
anywhere within its repeated motif, and can appear as either forward or reverse
complement.

Total length of the genome is 3.3Mbp, of which 2.1Mbp is repeats.

The genome is in genome3.fa. Positions of the embedded motifs, in the genome,
are recorded in genome3.truth.dat.

Fake reads were sampled from this genome, using the same methods as were used
for mock_hg38.

The simulated reads are in genome3.pacbio.fa and genome3.nanopore.fa. True
alignments of the reads, to the genome, are recorded in genome3.pacbio.cigars
and genome3.nanopore.cigars. True alignments of the embedded motif intervals on
the reads are recorded in genome3.pacbio.truth.ncrf and
genome3.nanopore.truth.ncrf, and more consisely in genome3.pacbio.truth.summary
and genome3.nanopore.truth.summary. The same caveats apply, regarding this
output not being from an aligner apply, as noted for mock_hg38.

# Truth File Formats

When a mock genome is generated, the positions of the embedded repeat arrays
*in the genome* are recorded in genome_name.truth.dat (or a gzipped equivalent).
This is a whitespace-delimited text file with seven columns. The first line is
a header line, beginning with a waffle (#) and providing the names of the
columns.

The columns are
```bash  
chrom,start,end    The interval containing the repeat array. Chrom is usually
                   the name of the genome. Start and end are origin-zero, half
                   open.
motif              The repeated motif. This has an optional suffix describing
                   the offset and orientation of the motif. For example,
                   "GGAAT.2+" indicates the array begins with the 3rd character
                   (the first A) and is on the forward strand.
rptLen             The number of bases in the repeat array.
len                The length of the interval containing the array (the same as
                   end-start). This will usually be identical to rptLen, but
                   allows for the possibility that some noise process has
                   changed the length of the array before it was embedded in
                   the genome.
fill               The length of random sequence inserted between this repeat
                   array and the closest one that precedes it.
```  

When simulated reads are pulled from a mock genome, the true alignments of the
reads to the genome are recorded in genome_name.technology_name.cigars. This
information is then used to recover the true alignments of the embedded repeat
arrays *in the reads* (discussed below). This is a whitespace-delimited text
file with five columns. There is no header line.

The columns are
```bash  
read               The name of the read.
chrom,gStart,gEnd  The interval ON THE GENOME from which the read was sampled.
                   This has an optional suffix describing the orientation of
                   the read relative to the genome. For example, "genome3-"
                   indicates the read was sampled from what would be the
                   genome's reverse strand. gStart and gEnd are origin-zero,
                   half open.
cigar              Cigar string describing the alignment. "M" indicates base(s)
                   in the read matching the genome, or mismatching (a
                   substitution). "I" indicates base(s) in the read that are
                   not in the genome. "D" indicates base(s) in the genome that
                   are not in the read.
```  

The true alignments of the embedded repeat arrays *in the reads* are recorded
in genome_name.technology_name.truth.ncrf (or a gzipped equivalent). This is
similar to the alignment format produced by NCRF (described in the tutorial
README), with two fields repurposed. First, where the motif and strand would
normally be indicated, .truth.ncrf files provide the aligned interval and
orientation on the genome. Second, the score field has no meaning in
.truth.ncrf files.

Alignments are separated from each other by blank lines. A typical alignment
block is shown below. Note that there may be other lines in a block, each
starting with a waffle (#).
```bash  
# score=1 querybp=539 mRatio=87.6% m=507 mm=7 i=40 d=25 =======x=============...
genome3_PACBIO_F_2560_12833     10757 554bp   3756-4310 GGAATGGGAATGGAATGGAAT...
genome3:6143-6682+                    539bp   score=1   GGAATGG-AATGGAATGGAAT...
```  

The true positions of the embedded repeat arrays *in the reads* are recorded in
genome_name.technology_name.truth.summary (or a gzipped equivalent). This is
nearly identical to the alignment summary format produced by ncrf_summary, but
column 1 is completely different and the meaning of some of the other columns
is also different. This is a whitespace-delimited text file with thirteen
columns. The first line is a header line, beginning with a waffle (#) and
providing the names of the columns.

The columns are
```bash  
genome             The aligned interval ON THE GENOME containing the portion of
                   the repeat array. This is of the form chrom:gStart-gEnd.
                   gStart and gEnd are origin-zero, half open. For example,
                   "genome3:6143-6682" indicates an interval of 539 bp on
                   genome 3. 
motif              The embedded repeat, e.g. "GGAAT".
seq,start,end      The aligned interval ON THE READ (seq is the read name).
strand             "+" indicates the aligned intervals are in the same
                   orientation; "-" indicates they are in opposing orientations.
seqLen             The length of the read (the entire read, not just the
                   aligned interval).
querybp            The number of bases in the aligned repeat. This should be
                   the same as gEnd-gStart.
mRatio             The ratio of matches to alignment events, as a percentage,
                   e.g. "85.7%". This is computed as m/(m+mm+i+d).
m                  The number of matched bases in the alignment.
mm                 The number of mismatched bases in the alignment.
i                  The number of inserted bases in the alignment -- bases in
                   the read which are not in the genome.
d                  The number of deleted bases in the alignment -- bases in
                   the genome which are not in the read.
```
