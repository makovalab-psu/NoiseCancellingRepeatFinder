# Implementation Notes:
#
# [1] Justification for "matches-insertions" (as opposed to just "matches").
#     When NCRF counts matches, a deletion (a base deleted from the motif)
#     outcomes in a decrease of the count of matches at that position. There is
#     no similar effect for an insertion (a base inserted into the motif).
#     Thus if we base our test solely on matches, insertions will not
#     contribute to the test. Subtracting insertion counts from match counts
#     gives insertions the same effect as deletions.
#
# [2] The min-max method introduces some non-determinism. It is expected that
#     this will only affect alignments near the pass/fail boundary. Whether
#     an alignment is passed or failed depends to some extent on the state of
#     the PRNG. This state is affected by the initial seed (which will be the
#     same for all runs unless the user sets it) and how many times the PRNG
#     has been called in processing previous alignments. Thus, even without
#     changing the seeding, an alignment processed in different runs with
#     different parameters (or appearing at a different relative position in
#     the input) is processed with a different PRNG state. It is likely that
#     alignments not close to the pass/fail boundary would not be affected.
#
# [3] Here we describe the format of the file produced by the unadvertised
#     option --report:matrix. The reason this option isn't advertised is that
#     is should only be useful to developers testing implementation details of
#     the underlying chi-squared test.
#
#     The file has NO header line and one row for each alignment;  2M+2 columns
#     per row, where M is the motif length. Column 1 is the line number of the
#     alignment in the incoming file. Column 2 is the outcome of the test. 
#     Columns 3 thru M+2 are positional match counts for that alignment, and
#     columns M+3 thru 2M+2 are the positional error counts. We assume all rows
#     have the same number of columns, i.e. that the same motif length is
#     represented in all rows.
#
# [4] The chi-squared test is no longer advertised, because it was found to be
#     flawed.

                        (default is 30)

In a "true" alignment to a given motif unit, we expect the errors to be
distributed randomly and uniformly among the positions in the unit. (That is
an underlying assumption, possibly not true.)  This program discards alignments
that fail a test based on that assumption.

Error counts are often too small for the statistical test, so a test based on
match counts is used instead. However, an insertion error does not reduce the
match count at any position, so by default we decrease matches by the number of
insertions at that position.

The input alignments must include position event information. This can be
accomplished by using the --positionalevents option of Noise Cancelling Repeat
Finder.

When test outcomes are reported for --discard:none, one of the following lines
is added to each alignment
# positional min-max: match-insert uniformity rejected
# positional min-max: match-insert uniformity not rejected
# positional min-max: untested
The "untested" case indicates that the min-max test could not be performed,
usually because one of the positional match counts is too small."""
