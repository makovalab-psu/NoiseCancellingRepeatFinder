usage: ncrf_resolve_overlaps <alignment_summary..> [options]
  <alignment_summary>    (cumulative) file(s) containing aligment summaries
                         for which overlaps are to be resolved
  --head=<number>        limit the number of input aligment summaries
  --out=<name_template>  file to write overlap groups to; see discussion of
                         name template below; if this option is absent, all
                         output is written to the console

The name template either names a single file or a collection of files.  If
if includes the substring "{motif}", this substring is replaced by a motif name
and any un-overlapped alignments to that motif are written to that file. If
the template name doesn't include "{motif}", all un-overlapped alignments and
overlapping groups are written to one file.

Overlapping groups are either written to the console (if no name template is
given), to the same file with alignments (if the name template doesn't contain
"{motif}"), or to a a file separate from the alignments (with "{motif}"
replaced by "overlaps").

The alignment summaries are usually the output from ncrf_summary. Any file may
contain alignments for more than one motif.

Typical input file:
  #line motif seq        start end  strand seqLen querybp mRatio m    mm  i  d
